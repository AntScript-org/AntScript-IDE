# AntScript-IDE
## Brief description
This is a new programming language i am developeing, for new game developers, who dont know anything about coding. AntScript is easy to handle, yet extremely powerfull and I hope it explodes soon!
More:
AntScript is a beginner-friendly programming language designed to be simpler and more approachable than Lua or HTML. Itâ€™s perfect for new coders who want to focus on learning programming concepts without being overwhelmed by complex syntax.

## Overview
- AntScript is still in development, but its goal is to provide:
- Simple, readable syntax: Easy-to-understand commands and structures.
- Functions & conditions: Clean ways to organize logic with func, if/else, and elseif.
- Variables & data types: Numbers, strings, booleans, and lists handled intuitively.
- Extensibility: Designed to grow with libraries and new features in the future.

## Syntax Preview:
### Functions:
```
func greet(name) {
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
}
```
### Conditions
```
if x > 10 {
    print("x is greater than 10")
} elseif x == 10 {
    print("x is 10")
} else {
    print("x is less than 10")
}
```
### Variables & Lists
```
localVar number = 42
folderVar text = "AntScript is fun!"
flag = true
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
## Why AntScript? 

- Makes programming less intimidating for beginners.
- Encourages learning through experimentation.
- Clean syntax helps users focus on logic, not punctuation.

## Roadmap:
- Some planned features for AntScript:
- Full compiler with .ant file support
- Standard library with math, string, and list utilities
- GUI support for beginners to experiment visually
- Documentation and tutorials
