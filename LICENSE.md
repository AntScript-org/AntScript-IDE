# AntScript Custom License v1.0

## Preamble
AntScript is a programming language and associated source files, libraries, and tools (collectively, the “Software”), created and maintained by Antboi123 (Sameer J) with contributions from ChatGPT-5-mini. The goal of this license is to allow the use of AntScript for programming and development while protecting the integrity and ownership of its source files.

## 1. Permissions

You are granted the right to:

Use AntScript for any purpose, including personal, educational, or commercial programming.

Develop games, applications, and other digital works using AntScript.

Distribute compiled programs, scripts, or projects created with AntScript without including or redistributing the source code or files of AntScript itself.


## 2. Restrictions

You may NOT:

Copy, modify, distribute, or sell the source code or files of AntScript without explicit written permission from the copyright holders.

Use any part of the source code, libraries, or files of AntScript in other programming languages, frameworks, or projects without prior authorization.

Claim ownership of the Software or any portion of it.

If unauthorized use of the Software source code occurs, you agree to:

- Immediately delete all copied or stolen source code.

- Remediate any damages as reasonably requested by the copyright holder, which may include a monetary fine for substantial misuse.


## 3. Attribution

Developers using AntScript are not required to credit the creators in their games or applications.

However, any request for access to AntScript source files requires written permission from the copyright holders, which may be granted or denied at their discretion.


## 4. Application and Game Distribution

Any game or application created with AntScript must include a copyright disclaimer that states:

“This product was developed using AntScript. AntScript source code is proprietary and may not be copied, distributed, or reused without permission.”

Users or players of such games may use the game freely, but may not extract, copy, or reuse AntScript source code from the game.

This clause does not restrict content creators (art, music, story, etc.) from distributing their own content, as long as they do not include AntScript’s source files.


## 5. Warranty and Liability

The Software is provided “as-is” without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose.

The authors are not liable for any damages, loss of data, or other issues arising from the use of AntScript.


## 6. Legal Enforcement

This license is governed by the laws of South Africa.

Any violation of this license gives the copyright holders the right to enforce removal of unauthorized source code, issue fines, or seek other remedies as legally available.


## 7. Additional Terms

This license does not restrict the use, creation, or distribution of projects made with AntScript, as long as the AntScript source code itself is not included or misused.

Workflow members, testers, or approved collaborators may have separate agreements granting limited access to source files, at the sole discretion of the copyright holders.
